# Current progress

Infinite world are working, gone is the blasted array-based storage of the world and a Sparse Octree has been introduced :) Beggining LOD development now.

LOD Development is not going to plan.

# Project Details
## Features
- Procedurally generated voxel terrain
- Advanced lighting with ambient occlusion
- Bloom and post-processing effects
- Real-time shadows
- Translucent materials
- Optimized chunk-based rendering

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to build the engine:
- **Visual Studio 2022** or newer
- **Vulkan SDK 1.4.0** or newer - [Download from LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
- **GLM** (included in the `external` directory)
- **STB_IMAGE** (included in the `external` directory)
- **FastNoiseSIMD** (included in the `external` directory)

## Build Instructions
### Setting up the environment
1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with C++ development workload
2. Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
3. Ensure that the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set correctly (typically done by the installer)

### Building the project
1. Open the solution file `voxceleron2.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Select the desired configuration (Debug or Release) and platform (x64 recommended)
3. Build the solution (F7 or Build â†’ Build Solution)
4. The executable will be created in `build\x64\[Configuration]\voxceleron2.exe`

### Building from Command Line
You can also build the project from the command line:

1. Launch the Visual Studio Developer PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   & 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1'
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and build using MSBuild:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\path\to\voxceleron2-engine
   MSBuild.exe voxceleron2.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
   ```

### Running the engine
Run the generated executable from Visual Studio or directly from the build directory. Resources will be automatically copied to the output directory.

## Controls
- **W, A, S, D**: Move forward, left, backward, right
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Shift**: Run faster
- **L**: Unlock Mouse

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter build errors:

1. Make sure the Vulkan SDK is properly installed and the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set
2. Check Visual Studio has the C++ desktop development workload installed
3. Verify that all required libraries are in their expected locations
