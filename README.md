# Voxceleron2 Engine

A voxel-based rendering engine built with C++ and Vulkan.

![Voxceleron2 Engine](https://example.com/screenshot.png)

## Features

- Procedurally generated voxel terrain
- Advanced lighting with ambient occlusion
- Bloom and post-processing effects
- Real-time shadows
- Translucent materials
- Optimized chunk-based rendering

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build the engine:

- **Visual Studio 2022** or newer
- **Vulkan SDK 1.4.0** or newer - [Download from LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
- **GLM** (included in the `external` directory)
- **STB_IMAGE** (included in the `external` directory)
- **FastNoiseSIMD** (included in the `external` directory)

## Build Instructions

### Setting up the environment

1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with C++ development workload
2. Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
3. Ensure that the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set correctly (typically done by the installer)

### Building the project

1. Open the solution file `voxceleron2.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Select the desired configuration (Debug or Release) and platform (x64 recommended)
3. Build the solution (F7 or Build â†’ Build Solution)
4. The executable will be created in `build\x64\[Configuration]\voxceleron2.exe`

### Running the engine

Run the generated executable from Visual Studio or directly from the build directory. Resources will be automatically copied to the output directory.

## Controls

- **W, A, S, D**: Move forward, left, backward, right
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Shift**: Run faster
- **L**: Unlock Mouse

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:

1. Make sure the Vulkan SDK is properly installed and the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set
2. Check Visual Studio has the C++ desktop development workload installed
3. Verify that all required libraries are in their expected locations
